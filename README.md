# Docker for Development

Odds are good that you've heard of Docker. Maybe you're even using it! In fact,
if you're using it, maybe this talk isn't for you. Or maybe it is!

Docker does a lot of great things, but one of the nicest things it can do is
make it easy to avoid (some of) the mess of setting up development environments.

We'll go through the basics of Docker, and by the end of the talk, you should
(hopefully) feel like you know the difference between Docker and VMs, between
images and containers, and maybe even have the confidence to go out and try it
for yourself!
